      <h1>Challenge</h1>
          <p>The chalenge in this lab was to create a webpage that would process JSON from an API through an AJAX call function.</p>

      <h1>Problems</h1>
          <p>Initially the problem was that we could not correctly access the JSON, a problem that was fixed once we installed CORS Unblock. The next was finally fixing the issue with the video background not properly adapting to new sizes to fit content.</p>

      <h1>Results</h1>
          <p>Once the extension was done, we were able to finally find a solution that allowed us to make the video responsive to content.</p> <br>
