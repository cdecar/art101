		<h1> Christian Decareau </h1>
		<p> I am a transfer student from City College of San Francisco, and this will be my second year here at UCSC in the Arts program. I have some C++ and Java knowledge from my former major of Computer Science, though I am very rusty. I enjoy boardgames, videogames, drawing, and occasional hikes. I hope that I am able to shake off some of that rust as I progress through this course.
