		<h3>Challenge</h3>
			<p> The challenge for this assignment was to create an array and an object with values imported from the previous lab and have them referenced in our html file</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p> For a good while the javascript was not displaying correctly, causing me to comb through any errors I may have made and double checking my steps. It was only after realizing that I used "=" instead of ":" to define the object's values that I was able to get it working correctly.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p> Once that was done, everything displayed correctly and worked well.</p>
