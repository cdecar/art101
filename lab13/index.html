      <h1>Challenge</h1>

          <p>The challenge of this lab was to make a javascript function that would test a range of numbers to see if they are divisible by various values, and if so, label them with a phrase.</p>


      <h1>Problems</h1>

          <p>One issue that had popped up was that the sheer amount of values tested and listed tore at the video and extended far beyond it, creating an unappealing white space below.</p>


      <h1>Results</h1>

          <p>In the end a compromise had to be made, and we ended up placing the results in a scrollable box so as not to mess with the video placing.</p> <br>


        <button class = "buttonStart" type = "button"> Begin</button>

        <div class = "textBox">
          <div id = "output">
          </div>
